# Advanced - Calculator

The app is developed in Java with a GUI. This advanced calculator supports real numbers, result clearing, character deletion, bracket operations, and basic arithmetic functions.


Important!!  -> Both files represent the same program and function identically. The only difference is that "CalculatorAvansatCuIcons" uses the "resources" file to extract icons, while "CalculatorulAvansatFaraIcons" does not require the "resources" file to run.
